## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Accordion layout (details and summary tags) and how to modify the layout. 
- Better understanding how to use flexbox. 
- Creating parent/child relationships to layer images.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on responsiveness and making specific classes to use among multiple elements (e.g., is-mobile-view, is-desktop-view). 

I want to continue doing projects to expose me to different techinques and requirements. 

### Useful resources

- Codepen was useful to help me understand how to customiz an accordion. Multiple examples were reviewed and tailored to make this accordion.
